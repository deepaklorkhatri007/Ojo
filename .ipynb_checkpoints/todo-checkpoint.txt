1. clean up the code
2. use ml to generalize the variables:
    - houghlinesP 
    - threshold value for binary image
    - 
3. better voice latency by using diffrent voice engine (tts)
4. hand writing recognition
5. after rotation use a classification code. if 0 (inverted) then rotate by 180
6. can remove dilation and erosion
7. for books detect a page (normal images later on)
8. optimize the kernel size according to page size in Morphological operations
9. possibly remove code for boxes
10. update to do list regularly :')
